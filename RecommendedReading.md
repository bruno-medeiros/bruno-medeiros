# The curriculum:
A selection of recommended reading in Software Engineering topics:

## Testing
 * https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html - good contrast between "classical and mockist" styles of TDD.
 Also terminology and description for the various kinds of test doubles. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double
 * https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing - good overview and explanation of various testing topics and strategies, especially when applied to microservices.

#### Concurrency
 * https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/basics.html - Terminology and concepts for concurrency (this is not about cats library). Of particularl interest: notes about "Asynchronous / Semantic blocking"
 * https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/46b543800958cf61af6efa8e072bfd5c - types of thread pools in JVM   

## Distributed Systems
 * **Lightbend Reactive Architecture** 6 course series - https://www.lightbend.com/learn/lightbend-reactive-architecture
   * Longer than a simple article, but this course series is excellent. It very well thought, it's great foundational material!
 * CAP theorem (a bit more advanced stuff, but still important):
   * http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem/ - eventual consistency & CAP in plain english
   * https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/ - modern info on CAP.
